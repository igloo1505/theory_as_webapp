# Earth's Peculiar Velocity Via Relativistic Expansive Geometry

This is a web representation of a paper I wrote recently regarding Einstein's _`On the electrodynamics of moving bodies'_. I worked as a freelance web and mobile developer for over 7 years while pursuing my own academic interests in my spare time when something occurred to me about Einstein's earliest work. It was in February of 2022 that an assumption Einstein made became clear to me, and I almost immediately finished my last bit of freelance work and began to work on this paper. The paper itself took me barely a month to write, but finding a way to distinguish it from current models took almost 9 months. In late October I was able to produce an equation that I believe can differentiate this model from current interpretations of relativity, which I will try to convey to a more generalized audience here... plus, I need a job now. :grin:

# Summary of the theory:

### Equivalence Principle:
Although the principle of equivalence was well understood before Einstein's general theory of relativity _(GR)_, his reliance on this principle was revolutionary in many ways. The equivalence principle simply states that gravity is completely indistinguishable from the pseudo force an observer would experience if an underlying platform was accelerated upwards at exactly $1g$.

From this equivalence, Einstein determined that the frequency $f_e$ emitted from source at some elevation $h$ above the surface of a gravitating object, this source would be observed on the surface according to the following equation:

$$
\tag{1}
f_r = f_e\sqrt{\frac{1 - \frac{2GM}{\left(R + h\right)c^2}}{1 - \frac{2GM}{Rc^2}}}
$$
Before addressing this equation, we should note the definition of our free fall velocity as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
F_g \coloneqq g \times m_{\prime} & = G \frac{m_{\prime} m_o}{r^2} \newline
g & = G \frac{m_o}{r^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

By defining the time elapsed as a light beam traverses a gravitational source as $\frac{2 r}{c}$ and some clever geometry, the path curvature of a massless photon can be defined through equation _(1)_.

From this equation we should note that this additional factor is very near $g \frac{h}{c}$, or the motion of this equivalence principle as our free frall gravitational acceleration $g$ as applied over the time it takes the light source to reach the receiver. Since $t = \frac{d}{v}$ and the distance between the receiver and emitter is $h$, which is being propagated at velocity $c$, $g \frac{h}{c} = g \Delta t$.
